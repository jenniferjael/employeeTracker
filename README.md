# Unit 12: MySQL

## Overview

When using applications, the most important to our users is being able to store and retrieve data. This app will help to determine the best way to deliver data to the front-end via our server-side API. 

## Key Topics

* MySQL Workbench

* MySQL command line prompt (MySQL Shell)

* Creating and dropping databases and tables

* schema.sql and seeds.sql files

* CRUD

* Primary and foreign keys

* Prepared statements

* Joins

* ACID

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is CRUD?

2. What is ACID? 

3. How does one join data between tables? 

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Configure a Node.js application to connect to a MySQL instance

* Create and drop databases and tables 

* Explain and execute CRUD methods

* Use both a GUI and the MySQL command line prompt to interface with a database

* Create schema and seed files for development and production

* Write join statements to establish relations between data in one or more tables

## Homework: Employee Tracker

* Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Heads Up

* Starting this unit, you will use MySQL. Be sure to have the MySQL Server and Workbench installed on your computer and be able to initialize the MySQL Shell **before** attending your classes. You can follow these installation instructions for your [Mac](./04-Important/mysql-mac-guide.md) or [Windows](./04-Important/mysql-windows-guide.md) computers.
