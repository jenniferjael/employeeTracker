## Overview

When using applications, the most important to our users is being able to store and retrieve data. This app will help to determine the best way to deliver data to the front-end via our server-side API.

* MySQL Workbench

* MySQL command line prompt (MySQL Shell)

* Creating and dropping databases and tables

* schema.sql and seeds.sql files

* CRUD

* Primary and foreign keys

* Prepared statements

* Joins

* ACID



## Objectives

* Configure a Node.js application to connect to a MySQL instance

* Create and drop databases and tables 

* Explain and execute CRUD methods

* Use both a GUI and the MySQL command line prompt to interface with a database

* Create schema and seed files for development and production

* Write join statements to establish relations between data in one or more tables
